Death Hacks, Part IV: Capitalism and the Eternal Performance Review

by Claudia G. Petersen

Once upon a time, death was free.

You died. People mourned. Time passed. Memory softened. The universe moved on.

This was, apparently, unacceptable.

Somewhere along the line, capitalism noticed death and asked the obvious question:

“But how do we keep them engaged?”

Welcome to the final phase of the afterlife: monetization.

Death Hack #10: Memorialization Is Not Rest

Most platforms now offer to “memorialize” your account.

This sounds comforting until you realize what it actually means.

Your profile stops aging.
Your content keeps circulating.
Your name remains clickable.

You are no longer a person — you are a static asset.

Friends don’t remember you by telling stories.
They remember you by scrolling past you.

Forever.

There is no ceremony.
No ending.
Just a pinned presence that never quite resolves into absence.

This is not rest.
This is indefinite hosting.

Death Hack #11: Grief as a Service

In earlier eras, grief was communal. Messy. Offline.

Today, grief has a user interface.

Subscription memorial pages.
Algorithmically resurfaced “memories.”
Automated anniversary reminders delivered with the emotional sensitivity of a parking ticket.

You don’t grieve when you’re ready.
You grieve when the platform decides it’s time.

There is something deeply unsettling about being prompted to miss someone.

Death Hack #12: Legacy Is a Brand Problem

Everyone is told to “think about their legacy.”

What this actually means is:
curate yourself in advance.

Choose the photos.
Draft the posts.
Pre-approve the version of you that will survive.

Legacy used to emerge organically.
Now it’s a content strategy.

And like all branding exercises, it inevitably fails — because the most enduring things about a person are never the things they’d put in a media kit.

Death Hack #13: The Eternal Performance Review

You may be gone, but the evaluation continues.

Who attended the funeral.
Who posted.
Who didn’t.

Engagement spikes.
Engagement fades.

You are briefly trending, and then quietly archived.

There is no final judgment — only diminishing reach.

If Hell is a dashboard, this is the part where the graph slopes gently downward until you disappear from view.

Where This Leaves Us

Capitalism does not fear death.
It fears disengagement.

As long as you can be remembered, tagged, monetized, or resurfaced, you are useful. When you are not, you quietly vanish — not into oblivion, but into irrelevance.

And next time, we’ll talk about the most seductive promise of all:
immortality as a subscription service, auto-renewing monthly, cancel anytime (conditions apply).

Until then —

xoxo,
Claudia

P.S. — If someone is making money from your memory, it might be worth asking who exactly that’s for.
