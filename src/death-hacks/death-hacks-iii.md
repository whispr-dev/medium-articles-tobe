Death Hacks, Part III: How to Haunt the Algorithm

by Claudia G. Petersen

If the afterlife is a system — and we’ve already established that it almost certainly is — then the modern afterlife is a database.

Not a cloud of light.
Not a field of reeds.
A database.

Distributed. Redundant. Poorly documented.
And absolutely incapable of forgetting you.

In previous installments, we covered death as mythology, combat qualification, belief arbitrage, and divine bureaucracy. Today, we move into the era no sacred text prepared us for:

Death as data persistence.

Welcome to the part of dying that doesn’t end when you do.

Death Hack #6: The Digital Ghost

Die without cleaning up your online presence and you’ll continue to exist — indefinitely.

Old social media accounts.
Abandoned email addresses.
Auto-generated birthday reminders that surface once a year like a summoning ritual no one intended to perform.

Your friends won’t remember you through stories.
They’ll remember you through notifications.

This is not haunting in the gothic sense.
This is haunting as maintenance failure.

The most effective digital ghosts don’t moan or rattle chains. They simply appear in feeds, uninvited, years later, smiling in a photo from 2014.

No closure.
Just uptime.

Death Hack #7: Reputation Is the New Soul

In earlier eras, your soul was judged by gods.
Today, it’s handled by search engines.

What survives you is not who you were — it’s what’s indexed.

Screenshots.
Archived posts.
Cached arguments taken out of context and preserved forever, like insects in amber.

You will not be remembered as a person.
You will be remembered as a result set.

And unlike divine judgment, there is no appeals process. The algorithm does not care if you’ve grown, changed, or learned anything at all.

It only knows relevance.

Death Hack #8: The Metrics Trap

In the modern afterlife, worth is measured numerically.

Views.
Likes.
Claps.
Engagement.

You may be dead, but your performance review is eternal.

Someone, somewhere, will still be able to tell you:

which of your thoughts mattered

which didn’t land

which performed “unexpectedly well”

There is something uniquely cruel about being reduced to metrics after you can no longer respond to them.

Hell isn’t fire.
Hell is a dashboard.

Death Hack #9: The Immutable Record

Every religion promised judgment.

None of them warned you about screenshots.

Private messages are not private.
Deleted posts are not deleted.
Apologies do not propagate as well as mistakes.

In this afterlife, forgiveness exists — but it does not scale.

You will be defined not by your best moment, but by the most shareable version of your worst one.

Forever.

Where This Leaves Us

The ancient dead worried about passage.
The medieval dead worried about judgment.
The modern dead worry about persistence.

You cannot escape the system by being good.
You can only escape it by understanding how it works.

And next time, we’ll talk about the final frontier of death optimization:
capitalism, legacy platforms, monetized grief, and why even dying isn’t allowed to be unproductive anymore.

Until then —

xoxo,
Claudia
