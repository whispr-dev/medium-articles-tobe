Death Hacks: The Ultimate Life Pro-Tips for Your Final Exit

by Claudia G. Petersen

Darling readers, we’ve all scrolled through endless lists of life hacks promising to revolutionize everything from our morning routines to our tax returns. But what about that final, inevitable life event we’re all frantically avoiding thinking about?

Death.

Death, my dear mortals, is the ultimate deadline (pun absolutely intended), and frankly, we’ve been woefully unprepared for our final performance review.

As someone who’s spent an unreasonable amount of time researching both classical literature and contemporary self-help culture (yes, I contain multitudes), I’ve come to a startling realization: our ancestors were far more practical about dying than we are. They left behind guides — literary, theological, mythological — that function suspiciously like early versions of modern life hacks.

Consider this your cheat sheet.

If we’re going to shuffle off this mortal coil, we might as well do it with strategy, style, and just enough irreverence to get us into trouble one last time.

Death Hack #1: The Dante Dodge

Before you die, commit a betrayal and you’ll be sent to the lowest level of Hell — where Satan himself flaps his wings, creating an eternally frozen environment.

That’s right. While everyone else is roasting in the upper circles, you’ll be down in Hell’s arctic penthouse suite. Dante’s Inferno is less a poem than a real-estate brochure, and the bottom floor is climate-controlled.

Yes, you’ll be frozen in ice.
But think of the skincare benefits.

Death Hack #2: The Charon Currency Exchange

Always carry two coins when you die — one for Charon’s ferry across the River Styx, and one as a tip.

Underworld customer service is notoriously bad, but gratuities still work wonders. While other souls stand around like tourists who forgot their metro cards, you’ll glide across the river with VIP treatment.

Good tippers get the window seat. And if you’re going to be dead forever, you might as well enjoy the view.

Death Hack #3: The Egyptian Investment Portfolio

Die during pyramid-construction season and your organs will be preserved in canopic jars, granting you the ultimate resurrection insurance policy.

Mummification was the ancient world’s answer to cryogenic freezing — only with better aesthetics and less tech-bro delusion. While modern humans spend thousands chasing immortality, the Egyptians perfected it with jars, incense, and interior design that still holds up.

Plus, you get real estate. Pyramid-adjacent real estate.

Final Thoughts (For Now)

Our ancestors didn’t panic about death — they prepared for it. They gamified it. They optimized it. Somewhere along the way, we lost that energy and replaced it with denial and productivity apps.

But don’t worry. The afterlife doesn’t stop with Hell, rivers, or pyramids.

Next time, we’ll explore combat loopholes, belief-system arbitrage, and why divine bureaucracy might be your greatest enemy — or your greatest opportunity.

After all, death isn’t the end.

It’s just the onboarding process.
