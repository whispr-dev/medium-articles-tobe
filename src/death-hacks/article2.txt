Death Hacks, Part II: Combat Death, Belief Arbitrage, and Divine Bureaucracy

by Claudia G. Petersen

If you read the previous installment, welcome back. If you didn’t — don’t worry. Death, like modern software, assumes you skipped the documentation anyway.

Last time, we explored how ancient civilizations treated death less like a tragedy and more like a logistics problem. Today, we move forward in time — into battlefields, belief systems, and the administrative nightmare that is the modern afterlife.

Things get… messier from here.

Death Hack #4: The Valhalla Loophole

Die in battle while holding a weapon — even if it’s just a butter knife during an aggressive dinner-party argument.

The Norse gods were warriors, not lawyers. The fine print for Valhalla admission is refreshingly vague. “Die in battle” sounds intimidating until you realize no one specified which battle.

Was it a battlefield?
A bar fight?
An argument over cheese knives?

Odin doesn’t ask follow-up questions. He just needs plausible deniability and a good story.

Death Hack #5: The Reincarnation Reset Button

Die while simultaneously believing in multiple religions — hedge your bets and let afterlife customer service sort it out.

Think of this as spiritual portfolio diversification. The afterlife is famously disorganized, and filing errors are common. Why submit a single application when you can apply everywhere at once?

Heaven. Nirvana. The Happy Hunting Ground.
Someone’s bound to have availability.

Divine HR loves initiative.

The Real Problem: Bureaucracy

Here’s the uncomfortable truth no religion advertises:

The afterlife is almost certainly run by administrators.

Forms. Rules. Queues. Exceptions. Appeals. Lost paperwork. Eternity spent waiting because someone misfiled your soul under “miscellaneous.”

Hell isn’t fire.
Hell is process.

Which explains why the most successful death strategies don’t rely on virtue — they rely on loopholes.

Where This Leaves Us

You can’t rehearse dying (well, you can, but insurance companies frown on it). But you can approach it like any other major life transition: with preparation, curiosity, and a willingness to exploit poorly designed systems.

Whether you’re planning to outwit Cerberus, sweet-talk Saint Peter, or quietly slip through a cosmic clerical error, remember:

The goal isn’t immortality.
It’s a smooth exit.

And next time? We’ll talk about digital ghosts, algorithmic hauntings, and how to ensure your posthumous online presence outlives your enemies.

Until then —
