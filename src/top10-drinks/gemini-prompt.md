fren, please can you write, as Claudia G. Petersen, an article to be published in Medium - lightharted and witty, intelligent but not degree level undertsanding required - assume high school graduate but explain anything more adance. The article is to be:
- Overall on the top 10 best selling softdrinks in the world, partly from a staistics point of view,but i don't want it to be purely an article on statistics - i'd like to dip into economics, advertising/sales theory and also to coer, for those with an interest in how thearticle was generated,a little on the code behind the various tables,charts and graphics employed were created.
- The article is to be entitled simply "What are the worlds top 10 soft drinks?".
- I want the economics aspect to discuss what coca cola have done so right to domiate the market quite so significantly.
- I want the advertising/marketing aspect to consider what strategies coca cola have employed so successfuly to dominate the market that others either haven't or have used less successfully.
- I'd like lots of analysis of the arious statistical aspects theat can be inferred from sales data of the top  10 either as % market share, sales in $ amounts, or unit volume.

Please base the article on the info included in the attached `.md` primarily but feel free to call upon any further info from other sources as required.
DO NOT miss out on any info included in the attached article.
DO NOT change the code in any way whatasoever, but do include it fully and completely.
put in the code sections in some kinda 'sub-sections', [perhaps boxed off?], along the lines of "for those of you interested in how the charts, graphics and grapphs were generated, here's the code to generate the output:", but do draw upon the comments in the attached `.md`.

DO remember at all times you're writing a Medium article - i.e. it needs to be detailed and interesting, educational, but keep it lighthearted and witty - so don't go into more depth than a highschool graduate could handle but dp credit the readers as having intelligence and credit them with the capability and desire to learn.

fren can you dig up any interesting coke speific facts along the lines of details about McDonalds strawsbeing specifically engineered for coke, the width being chosen to be perfect for coke's degree of carbonation/bubble size etc. and the recommended ice content which McDonalds fill their cups with based on cokes recommendation - i.e. we're on a bit of a conspiracy hunt for how coke engineer the whole world to be suited to _their_ particular attempts for best results...

...or the fact Santa is red with white trim is in fact due to a coca cola ad from a c.1900s ad for coke that featured a red 'n white Santa - and ever since, welp, red 'n' wjite santa has dominated xmas - all due to coke advertising power!
