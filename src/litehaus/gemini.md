This is a "literature review" of the current landscape of projects that align with the spirit of your Internet Lighthouses initiative.



Based on your description—involving everything from "simple li'l coded websites" to "atomic clocks"—your project sits at a fascinating intersection between The Small Web (artistic, personal, human-scale), Network Topography (mapping the physical reality of the internet), and Precision Timekeeping (the hardcore engineering of "when" we are).



Here is the lay of the land for projects in your sphere, ranging from homebrew art to massive institutional grids.



1\. The "Small Web" \& Artistic Beacons

These projects act as "lighthouses" in the sense of signalling presence, human activity, or environmental conditions. They are often reactions against the centralized, "always-on" cloud.



Solar Protocol: A network of solar-powered servers hosted by volunteers around the world. The website is served from whichever node is currently receiving the most sunshine. It is a literal "lighthouse" that follows the sun.



Status: Active.



Relevance: Highly similar to your "beacons" concept but with an environmental constraint.



Low Tech Magazine (Solar Server): A single-instance version of the above. It is a read-only website hosted on a solar-powered controller in Barcelona. When the battery dies (cloudy days), the site goes offline. It features a battery meter on the site itself.



Status: Active.



Webrings (The OG Lighthouses): In the 90s, webrings were the primary way to navigate the "dark seas" of the web. They are experiencing a renaissance via the IndieWeb movement.



Modern implementations: IndieWeb Webring, Hotline Webring, and CS.S Joy.



Relevance: These function as "repeaters," passing traffic from one small beacon to another.



Permacomputing Projects: A community focused on radical sustainability and longevity. Projects often involve "scavenged" hardware (old router beacons) or "collapse-OS" style minimalism.



2\. Institutional \& "Hardcore" Network Beacons

These are the "official" lighthouses—hardware and software designed to prove the internet is working, map its shape, or keep it synchronized.



RIPE Atlas: This is likely the closest functional equivalent to a "network of physical lighthouses." It is a global network of thousands of hardware probes (anchors) hosted by volunteers. They constantly "ping" the internet to measure connectivity and reachability.



Status: Very Active (Institutional).



Relevance: If you built a "hardware" version of your lighthouse, it would look like this.



The Opte Project: An artistic/technical effort to visually "map" the internet using traceroute data. It creates biological-looking maps of the internet’s nervous system.



Status: Historic/Periodic updates.



Internet Topology Zoo: A project by the University of Adelaide that collects and maps the network topologies of hundreds of ISPs and networks to understand the internet's structure.



3\. The "Time Nuts" (Atomic Clocks \& Precision)

You mentioned atomic clocks. There is a subculture of people who are obsessed with "Stratum 1" time—getting time directly from GPS or atomic sources rather than over the internet.



NTP Pool Project: A massive volunteer effort where people configure their servers to act as "beacons" of time for the rest of the internet. If you run a server, you can join the pool to help "keep the world on time."



Raspberry Pi Stratum 1 Servers: There is a thriving community of hobbyists who attach GPS/PPS (Pulse Per Second) modules to Raspberry Pis to create their own home atomic clocks.



Key search terms: "GPS HAT," "Stratum 1 NTP," "Meinberg."



Time-Nuts Mailing List: The "high temple" of this hobby. These are people buying surplus rubidium atomic clocks from eBay to keep time accurate to the nanosecond in their basements.



4\. Metaphorical \& Educational Projects

"Blinking Lights" Projects: There is a long history of "blinking lights" as a status symbol in computing (e.g., the Connection Machine). Modern makers often build physical "Internet Traffic Monitors" that blink LEDs based on ping times or packet loss—literal lighthouses for their home network.



The Physical Web (Google Beacon Project): An (now mostly defunct) effort to have physical objects broadcast URLs to nearby phones via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It was an attempt to turn physical locations into digital lighthouses.



Summary: Where You Fit In

Your Internet Lighthouses project seems to be unique in that it appears to gamify or aesthetize the concept of the network node.



RIPE Atlas is too dry/utilitarian.



Solar Protocol is too art-school/conceptual.



NTP Pool is too invisible (backend only).



You are likely building the "UI" layer for this concept—giving a visual identity and "place" to the simple act of a server saying "I am here, and I am lit."
