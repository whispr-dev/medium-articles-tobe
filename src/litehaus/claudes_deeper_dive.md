Right fren, here's the academic literature on beacon networks and repeaters that's out there:



Wireless Sensor Network Time Synchronization

A comprehensive PhD thesis from the University of Liverpool (2021) by Xintao Huan provides deep research into wireless sensor network beacon-based time synchronization. The work introduces BATS (Beaconless Asymmetric Time Synchronization), which eliminates beacon message flooding through networks, instead embedding synchronization data within reverse one-way message dissemination. The research achieved microsecond-level time synchronization accuracy while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to flooding time synchronization protocols. The thesis addresses three core aspects: computational complexity reduction via asymmetric high-precision time synchronization (AHTS), energy-efficient beaconless schemes, and per-hop delay compensation (PHDC) for multi-hop accuracy improvement.

Wi-Fi Beacon Collision Research

Bankov et al. (2019) from the IEEE 802.11ax working group investigated beacon collisions in dense Wi-Fi networks, demonstrating that beacon collisions are typical in residential networks and cause unexpected malfunction. Their paper addresses the hidden station problem in overlapped networks where even access points can be hidden from each other, causing continuous beacon collisions that break internet access and trigger disassociation. The research examined mechanisms under consideration by IEEE 802.11ax for avoiding beacon collisions in stadiums, airports, offices, and residential buildings.

BLE Beacon Mesh Networks

Lin et al. (2018) developed a real-time locating system combining Bluetooth Low Energy broadcast and mesh topologies to create interactive beacon networks. The unique contribution augments BLE beacon devices with mesh network capability, enabling many-to-many device communications and interactive applications fulfilled solely on BLE transport. The system architecture describes message design principles for beacon networks operating within mesh topologies.

IoT Beacon Architecture

Prabakaran et al. (2022) proposed the ATLAS framework featuring novel IoT architecture and secure networking stack for anonymous localization and tracking. This academic work addresses secure open-source networking protocols for beacon-based IoT systems. Research published in PMC (2022) by Hammad and Mohamed examined multihop multiantenna power beacon path selection methods for wireless sensor networks in intelligent structures. Their work investigates power beacons (PBs) based on time switching models for achieving great energy consumption and increasing wireless transmission range in large-scale networks, with beacons incorporated or deployed separately from base stations.

Quantum Repeater Networks

Advanced quantum repeater research from the University of Stuttgart (2025) explores protocols for secure quantum communication networks. The "Quantenrepeater.Link" project developed basic components for quantum repeaters that store quantum information on network nodes, perform operations on quantum states, and pass information to subsequent nodes. Benchasattabuse et al. (2023) published architecture and protocols for all-photonic quantum repeaters in arXiv, proposing communication protocols outlining classical data passage between network nodes with state tracking and Pauli frame correction calculations.

Beacon Network Optimization

Academic work from Wiley (2013) by researchers at TU Berlin addressed distributed beacon drifting detection for localization in unstable wireless networks. The beacon self-scoring and beacon-to-beacon negotiation mechanisms improve detection accuracy while keeping algorithms lightweight. Nayebi et al. (2011) evaluated beaconing design in mobile wireless networks, proving periodic beaconing (widely used for simplicity) is optimal in terms of beacon hits. IET research on optimization-based deployment of beacons for indoor positioning proposes signal power ranking (SPR) approaches to enhance positioning accuracy.

Network Security Beacon Detection

Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute published research on traditional and advanced network beacon detection techniques for cybersecurity applications. Their work addresses challenges including multiple protocol types (HTTP/HTTPS/DNS), cloud migrations, TLS encryption reducing metadata availability, and pattern detection over hours to days requiring patience. The research explores HDDBSCAN, OPTICS, pycluster, and graph-based approaches for improving network connection windows and comparing individual beacons versus aggregates.

​



Clock Synchronization for Distributed Systems

Recent work from PMC (2024) proposes mixed approaches for clock synchronization in distributed data acquisition systems using System on Chip architectures. The research addresses network synchronization protocols like NTP for geographically distributed IoT where clock distribution becomes infeasible. Phase shift measurements between clock signals enable reconstruction of sampling time differences from sampled values across distributed boards.

The academic landscape shows strong research activity around beacon network architectures spanning WSN time synchronization, Wi-Fi collision avoidance, BLE mesh systems, quantum repeater protocols, and security-focused beacon detection—all potentially relevant to your internet lighthouses concept.
