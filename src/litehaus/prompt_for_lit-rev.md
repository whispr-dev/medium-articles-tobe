Fren please can you do me a real deep dive research kinda literature review to see if anyone out there has undertaken any projects similar to my internet lighthouses (https://litehaus.online). i'm interested in anything from:

- home/personal projects just simple li'l coded websites/basic beacons n repeaters n stuff

- more official institutional/university/organized projects in a similar vein

- efforts to involve atomic clocks or stuff real fancy, whether home/commercial/institutional/university/whatever

- schools or colleges or other projects



basically, anything you can find whatsoever in the similar sphere to my project just so i have a clue as to the lay of the land as it currently exists, is planned or has existed in the past but ceased to be also.
