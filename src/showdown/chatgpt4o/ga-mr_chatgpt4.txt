This is indeed an intriguing case, fren. To get to the bottom of it, could you clarify a few things for me:

Would you like me to focus on researching the track itself ('Mahatma Regatta' by Gabriel Ananda) — its origin, release history, and distribution status?

Should I also investigate the possible takedown reason for your specific DJ mix #11 and its removal from the YouTube playlist?

Are you looking for any concrete links to where the track might still exist in downloadable or purchasable form (legally or via archival means)?

Would you like me to look into the references to 'elephants' in the comments, to see if they’re metaphorical, part of a meme, or tied to the music scene somehow?

Let me know which of these areas you’d like prioritized or if all are equally important.

1. It's very much the track itself i'm curious about.
2. i'm not so worried about reasons fortakedown of my DJ mixfrom the youtube playlist.
3. I have already tracked down links to the track non youtube as given in the initial prompt.
4. I am interested in any relevance of elephants as mentioned in the comments section.
The aactual status of the track itself is very much my area of priority.

Got it, fren. I'll investigate the track 'Mahatma Regatta' by Gabriel Ananda—its release status, history, and reasons why it appears to have been scrubbed from all major platforms like Spotify, Discogs, and SoundCloud. I'll also look into the 'elephant' references in the YouTube comments for any cultural or contextual significance. I'll get back to you with what I uncover.

Status and Disappearance of Gabriel Ananda's 'Mahatma Regatta'

The Mystery of Gabriel Ananda’s “Mahatma Regatta” Track
Release and Sudden Disappearance of “Mahatma Regatta”
“Mahatma Regatta” is indeed a real track by German techno producer Gabriel Ananda, released in mid-2008. It came out as the A-side of a two-track vinyl EP titled Endlich 17 on the Platzhirsch Schallplatten label
minimaland.blogspot.com
. The record (catalog number PLATZHIRSCH 17) featured “Mahatma Regatta” (A1) and a B-side called “Rattamahatta”
distribution.triplevision.nl
. This was part of the mid-2000s minimal/tech-house scene – Platzhirsch was a German minimal techno label, and the EP was released on vinyl (12″, 33 RPM) around July 2008
minimaland.blogspot.com
. At the time of release, “Mahatma Regatta” was well-received in its niche. A contemporary blog praised Endlich 17 as “one of the best [EPs] I heard from [Ananda] lately,” noting the A-side’s eerie piano over a steady beat and the B-side’s “superb reverbed bassline” that builds intensity step by step
minimaland.blogspot.com
. The second track “Rattamahatta” was highlighted as a real crowd-mover that “pushes you through the limits…over and over!”, expected to “surely rise the moods” on the dancefloor
minimaland.blogspot.com
. In short, the EP showcased two different sides of Gabriel Ananda’s style – the A-side more subtle and melodic, and the B-side an energetic, driving workout
minimaland.blogspot.com
. Despite this promising release, “Mahatma Regatta” rather quickly faded into obscurity. The Platzhirsch label itself did not have a long lifespan beyond that era (its website is now defunct and even the domain is for sale) – suggesting the label shut down or stopped releasing music in the years after

. As a result, the track never saw a broad re-release or digital push once the vinyl run was done. It was available as a paid download on stores like Juno Download (and possibly Beatport) for a time
minimaland.blogspot.com
, but it never made it onto major streaming services like Spotify. Gabriel Ananda’s Spotify catalog today has dozens of tracks, but “Mahatma Regatta” is conspicuously absent (likely because the rights remain with the old label or were simply never licensed for streaming). Essentially, after its 2008 vinyl pressing sold out, the track slipped through the cracks of the digital transition – effectively vanishing from official channels.
Why It’s “Erased” from the Internet
Calling it “erased” is a bit dramatic, but from a fan’s perspective it felt that way. Unlike most of Ananda’s other work (many of which have found their way onto compilations, re-releases, or streaming), “Mahatma Regatta” became hard to find anywhere except on that original vinyl or obscure corners of the internet. The track doesn’t show up in Discogs searches under Gabriel Ananda’s main discography at first glance, and it wasn’t included in later digital retrospectives or albums. In fact, the Endlich 17 EP was a relatively minor release that didn’t get widespread mention afterward – it wasn’t a big hit like Ananda’s famous “Doppelwhipper” (2006) or others which got re-licensed. One can still find evidence of it on Discogs and old shop listings (e.g. vinyl retailers listed Endlich 17 as sold out at around €7.99

). But these are archival traces; casual listeners or streaming-era fans would never encounter the tune. The YouTube situation adds to the mystery. You discovered that your DJ mix (which included “Mahatma Regatta”) was taken down from YouTube for copyright, even though none of the other mixes in that series were affected. This suggests that rights for this specific track were being enforced, perhaps automatically. It’s possible that a rights-holder (maybe a distributor who manages Platzhirsch’s back-catalog) flagged the audio. This is somewhat ironic, because DJ mixes on YouTube often fly under the radar unless a track is in a fingerprint database. The fact that only your mix #11 was removed implies “Mahatma Regatta” was the culprit – likely the Content ID system matched it or a manual claim was issued. That in turn implies someone, somewhere (perhaps an aggregator or the artist/label’s representative) had registered the track for protection. However, they haven’t made the track available in any official way for listeners – creating that frustrating situation where it’s blocked but not purchasable/streamable through normal means. In short, the track wasn’t deliberately scrubbed from history, but due to label inactivity and copyright algorithms it ended up largely inaccessible: a kind of “lost” track that only survives via fan uploads.
The Elephant in the Room: What’s with the Elephants?
You noticed a couple of strange references to “elephants” in the YouTube comments for the track. While this might seem cryptic, it likely has to do with the track’s sound and vibe rather than any literal elephant-related story. In the comments (mostly German), listeners were probably using metaphor or humor to describe “Mahatma Regatta.” In electronic music slang, especially among techno/minimal fans, it’s not unheard of to liken a heavy, thumping groove to elephants stomping. Given that “Mahatma Regatta” and especially its B-side “Rattamahatta” were noted for a deep, pounding bassline and driving rhythm
minimaland.blogspot.com
, it’s plausible someone said it hits “like an elephant march” or joked that “the elephants are dancing to this.” For example, a German commenter might have said something like “Stampft wie eine Herde Elefanten!” (“stomps like a herd of elephants!”) to convey how heavy and chunky the beat is. This would explain those elephant remarks as basically colorful praise for the track’s impact. Another angle: around that same era, there was a well-known minimal track by Minilogue called “Elephant’s Parade” (2007) – also a thundering, bass-heavy tune. It’s possible that fans drew a playful comparison between “Mahatma Regatta” and an “elephant parade,” or were referencing that Minilogue track in relation to Ananda’s song. If a comment was like “Elefantenmusik!” it’s likely just highlighting the massive, stomping quality of the track’s groove. In any case, there is no literal connection to elephants in the content of “Mahatma Regatta” – no elephant noises or anything officially in the track lore. The elephant comments appear to be an inside joke or metaphor among those who felt the track’s hefty bassline. (So don’t worry, you didn’t miss some secret elephant-themed version of the song – it’s just a figure of speech by enthusiastic listeners.)
So, What the Heck Is Going On?
In summary, the mystery unraveled as follows: “Mahatma Regatta” was a legitimate Gabriel Ananda release from 2008, put out on a small German label and never widely reissued
minimaland.blogspot.com
. Over time, as the music industry moved to streaming and the label folded, the track became digitally scarce – effectively hidden from the internet’s easily accessible music platforms. It wasn’t so much “erased” by a grand design as it was a casualty of music distribution changes (and possibly some overzealous copyright policing). The only places it survived were in offline collections, niche download stores, or unofficial uploads. When you finally tracked it down on YouTube, the uploader had no extra info because there really isn’t much info out there – it’s an obscure track that escaped the spotlight. The good news is that you’re not crazy – the track is real, and you did find proof of its existence (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.). The bad news, if any, is that its rarity is genuine: it’s a kind of lost gem that even Discogs and Spotify failed to clearly catalog for casual searches. As for the elephants, they’re just a whimsical way some fans acknowledged the track’s heavy impact – a testament to how “Mahatma Regatta” can trample a dancefloor (in the best way) despite its elusive status. In the end, nothing supernatural happened to the song; it’s simply a victim of niche-release obscurity and perhaps a quirk of naming. So, the “what the hecc” of it all is that this beloved tune of yours turned out to be a hidden treasure of the minimal techno era – one that requires a bit of digging (and perhaps pachyderm-like perseverance) to unearth today. Enjoy the rediscovery!

showing two sides of this awesome producer. The a side is a very well produced track, the disturbed piano along the beat does it for me... but i can't say that this one will produce a dancefloor madness. What i can say is that the second music will completely push the feelings up to the crowd. "Rattamahatta" starts with a superb reverbed bassline and a construction step by step just as we like it. It goes pushing you through the limites... over and over! I hope he will play it tonight, it will surely rise the moods! For those who don't know this Ep, it's time to take a look, specially the second music, it's one of a kind :) Released on Platzhirsch Schallplatten.
