Similarity to “Mahatma Regatta”?
Both tracks share a deep-house/tech-house vibe with stompy, melodic basslines and punchy grooves—characteristics that might hint at why listeners in the Gabriel Ananda comments used elephant imagery.

In forums, fans often say “Side-by-side they are VERY similar” referring to “Walking with Elephants” when comparing it to other tracks 
. This strengthens the idea that the elephant comments under "Mahatma Regatta" stem from that recognizable elastic, stomping feel.

Why Fans Mentioned “Elephants”
1. Strong sonic imagery
“Walking with Elephants” has that hypnotic, bouncing trumpet hook and booming low end that stick in your head—and this same energy is present in “Mahatma Regatta.” The elephant motif is likely a shared metaphor among fans to describe that big, stomping groove.

2. Cross-reference of similar tracks
The success of Ten Walls' hit made “Walking with Elephants” synonymous with that deep, stompy house feel. When listeners hear similar energy in Gabriel Ananda’s work, they draw a natural parallel.

✅ TL;DR for Your Mystery
Track	Release	Style	Why Elephant References?
Mahatma Regatta	2008 minimal techno	Deep, stompy bass	Fans borrowed elephant imagery from Ten Walls-era deep house, not literal connection
Walking with Elephants	2014 house hit	Elastic, bouncing groove	The elephant metaphor originates here and migrated among techno/deep‑house fans

Conclusion: The elephant comments under the Gabriel Ananda track are likely fans borrowing metaphors from the bigger, well-known Ten Walls track. The groove reminded them of “Walking with Elephants,” hence the playful elephant imagery in the comments.

If you want to explore more remixes or deeper analysis on the resemblance, I’m happy to help—just say the word!

he had all the pieces. he even had the crucial clues and seemed to be going down the right path with Ten Walls controversy... but he blew it. nope - din't make that final connection even with all those sources for research on the quick follow-up. oop.

oh poor ChatGPT - close but no cigar! even given the extra hintinfo, he never quite nailed the full picure and so tho he got really really close, he doesn't quite live up to his full potential. sorry, but even with a good enough answer to the first part of the puzzle, lack of excessive conspiracy spiralling and a nice `.pdf` formatted option as well as `.docx` alt etc. - he just didn't quite complete the course. 8.5/10
