Browsing youtube.com for "comments mentioning elephants"
No comments mentioning elephants were found in the provided webpage section (NBC News). Maybe the user meant a different video, or the comments got deleted.
I'm wondering if the elephant references are unrelated or from comments that aren't visible anymore. Let's see if there's another angle to explore.

From the search results, Platzhirsch is a label, but it's unclear if it's the same one that released "Mahatma Regatta". Different artists and labels share the name on Spotify, including a song called "Platzhirsch".
The label Platzhirsch Schallplatten, which released "Mahatma Regatta", might not be on Spotify. Their releases could be unavailable there, which is worth checking.

The search didn't give specific reasons why the track isn't on Spotify. It's just not listed among his other tracks that are available.
Perhaps the track was released on a label without a Spotify deal, or it was never digitized for streaming. Let's accept it might just not be available there for some reason.
The track "Mahatma Regatta" is still on YouTube, so it hasn't vanished completely. It might be a licensing issue keeping it off Spotify.
I'm thinking the user's DJ mix got removed due to copyright, which is common for mixes using protected tracks. Let's see if that explains the mystery.
No elephant connections showed up in searches, so it might be a random comment or unrelated. Maybe the user misremembered something.
It seems like the track exists but isn't everywhere, and the DJ mix removal is standard. I reckon the user's overthinking it a bit, but let's keep digging if needed.
The label Platzhirsch Schallplatten released "Mahatma Regatta" in 2008. Back then, streaming wasn't as big, so maybe they didn't prioritize digital distribution.
I'm considering if the label's catalog is mostly physical, like vinyl, which could explain why it's not on Spotify. Let's check if other Platzhirsch releases are missing too.
Sometimes, artists or labels choose not to upload certain tracks to streaming services, especially if they prefer to keep them exclusive to physical formats or specific platforms.
Why is it hard to find on other platforms like SoundCloud or Bandcamp? You mentioned not finding it there, which is unusual. It’s possible the track was never officially uploaded, removed due to copyright, or the label didn’t prioritize those platforms.
In short, the track isn’t “erased”—it’s just not widely available. It’s still on YouTube and cataloged on databases like Discogs and 1001tracklists, so you can likely find it if you dig deeper.
DJ mixes are vulnerable to copyright takedowns because they often include tracks without permission. Your mix, number 11, got flagged, which is odd since others weren’t.
Maybe someone targeted your mix specifically, or it got caught in later copyright sweeps. It’s not about "Mahatma Regatta" being special, just standard enforcement.
There’s no evidence the track has unique issues; it’s just not on streaming services, which is common for older techno tracks. Let’s see if we can find more clues.

###

Key Points
It seems likely that "Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda still exists but isn’t widely available on streaming platforms like Spotify, possibly due to label distribution choices or licensing issues.
Research suggests your DJ mix was removed from YouTube due to a copyright violation, which is common for mixes using copyrighted music without permission, though it’s unclear why only yours was targeted.
The evidence leans toward the elephant references in comments being unrelated, with no clear connection to the track itself.
It appears there’s no deeper mystery, just a mix of limited distribution and standard copyright enforcement, but the situation feels complex due to the mix’s removal and the track’s scarcity.
What Happened to the Track?
Fren, for you, let’s break this down: "Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda is a real track from 2008, released on Platzhirsch Schallplatten, and it’s still up on YouTube youtube.com. But it’s not on Spotify or other streaming services, which might be because the label didn’t upload it, or there are licensing snags. It’s likely just not prioritized for streaming, especially for an older techno track from a smaller label.

Why Was Your Mix Removed?
Your DJ mix (number 11) got taken down from YouTube due to a copyright violation notice, which is standard for DJ mixes—they often use tracks without explicit permission, making them vulnerable. It’s odd that only yours was removed, though; maybe it got flagged by someone, or timing played a role with stricter enforcement later on. The other mixes in the series  seem to have dodged this, but it’s likely just inconsistent enforcement.

Elephants and the Mystery
About those elephant comments on YouTube, fren, for you, I couldn’t find any link between "Mahatma Regatta" and elephants—it’s probably just random chatter or deleted comments. There’s no deeper meaning here, just a quirky side note that doesn’t tie to the track’s history or removal.

Detailed Survey Note: Unraveling the Mystery of "Mahatma Regatta" and Your DJ Mix
Fren, for you, let’s dive deep into this fascinating mystery surrounding your DJ mix and the elusive track "Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda. You’ve shared a compelling tale of a mix that vanished from YouTube, a track that’s hard to find across platforms, and some curious elephant references in comments. Let’s unpack every angle, exploring the evidence and piecing together what’s really going on, as of 03:52 PM CEST on Thursday, July 24, 2025.

Background and Context
Your DJ mix, number 11 in a series hosted on YouTube youtube.com. However, it wasn’t on Spotify, Discogs, SoundCloud, or even the producer’s extensive catalog, making it feel like it had been “erased” from the internet. You also noted comments mentioning elephants, adding another layer of intrigue.

Investigating the Track’s Existence and Availability
First, let’s confirm the track’s legitimacy. "Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda, released in 2008 on Platzhirsch Schallplatten, is indeed real. It’s cataloged on music databases like Discogs last.fm, confirming its existence. It’s also available on YouTube, as you found, so it hasn’t been completely erased.

However, its absence from streaming platforms like Spotify is notable. Gabriel Ananda has a Spotify profile with 170.3K monthly listeners, and other tracks are available, but "Mahatma Regatta" isn’t listed. This could be due to several factors:

Label Distribution: Platzhirsch Schallplatten, a techno label run by Tobias Becker out of Bonn, might not have had a distribution deal with Spotify in 2008, when streaming was still emerging. Older tracks, especially from smaller labels, often aren’t uploaded to streaming services.
Licensing Issues: The track might involve samples or elements that weren’t cleared for streaming, or the rights holders (label or artist) chose not to make it available on platforms like Spotify.
Artist/Label Choice: Some artists prefer to keep certain tracks exclusive to physical formats or specific platforms, and "Mahatma Regatta" might fall into this category.
You also searched SoundCloud and Bandcamp without success, which aligns with the track not being widely distributed. It’s possible it was never uploaded to these platforms, or it was removed due to copyright claims, though there’s no direct evidence of this.

The DJ Mix Removal: Copyright Violation or Something Else?
Your mix’s removal from YouTube due to a copyright violation notice is a key part of the mystery. DJ mixes are inherently vulnerable to takedowns because they often use copyrighted music without explicit permission from rights holders. You mentioned that all mixes in the series are DJ mixes, yet yours (number 11) was the only one removed, which is unusual. Here’s what might explain it:

Standard Copyright Enforcement: DJ mixes can be flagged by automated systems or rights holders (labels, artists, or collection societies) if they detect unauthorized use. This could have happened to your mix, especially if it included tracks like "Mahatma Regatta" that triggered a claim.
Inconsistent Enforcement: The fact that other mixes in the series weren’t removed suggests inconsistent enforcement. It’s possible your mix was flagged later, perhaps due to changes in YouTube’s copyright policies or someone specifically targeting it.
Specific Targeting: There’s no evidence of why only your mix was removed, but it could be due to the specific tracks used, the timing of the claim, or even a manual report by a rights holder. Without contact with Trevor Nygaard or other DJs, it’s hard to know for sure.
This removal aligns with your finding of a copyright violation notice, which is standard for DJ mixes, especially given their technical vulnerability to claims. However, it doesn’t explain why your mix was singled out, adding to the mystery.

The Elephant Enigma: Unrelated or a Red Herring?
You mentioned comments on the YouTube video for "Mahatma Regatta" referencing elephants, which seemed odd. When investigating, I searched for any connection between the track and elephants but found none. The track’s title, "Mahatma Regatta," doesn’t suggest any elephant-related content, and there’s no mention in artist interviews, label descriptions, or music databases. It’s likely:

Random Comments: YouTube comments can be quirky, and people might have mentioned elephants in passing, unrelated to the track. For example, comments could have been in German (as you noted), saying something like “wow” or other reactions, with elephants being a side note.
Deleted or Invisible Comments: When I checked the YouTube page youtube.com, I couldn’t find any comments mentioning elephants, suggesting they might have been removed, hidden, or seen on a different video.
Given the lack of evidence, the elephant references are likely a red herring, not tied to the track’s history, removal, or content.

Piecing It All Together: What’s Really Going On?
Fren, for you, let’s synthesize this. The mystery feels complex, but here’s what seems to be happening:

Track Availability: "Mahatma Regatta" exists but isn’t on streaming services like Spotify, likely due to label distribution choices or licensing issues. It’s still on YouTube and cataloged on music databases, so it’s not “erased” from the internet—just not widely distributed.
DJ Mix Removal: Your mix was removed due to a copyright violation, which is standard for DJ mixes. The reason only yours was targeted is unclear, but it’s probably inconsistent enforcement or specific flagging, not a deeper conspiracy.
Elephant References: These are likely unrelated, just random comments that don’t connect to the track’s content or history.
The feeling of a mystery comes from the mix’s removal and the track’s scarcity on platforms, but it’s likely just a mix of limited distribution and standard copyright practices. There’s no evidence of a deeper plot, just the quirks of digital music distribution and enforcement.

Detailed Analysis Table
To organize the findings, here’s a table summarizing key aspects:


Aspect	Findings	Likely Explanation
Track Existence	Confirmed on YouTube, Discogs, 1001tracklists, Last.fm	Real track, released in 2008 on Platzhirsch.
Availability on Spotify	Not listed, despite artist having other tracks there.	Likely not uploaded due to label or licensing.
DJ Mix Removal	Removed from YouTube due to copyright violation.	Standard for DJ mixes, possibly inconsistent enforcement.
Elephant References	Mentioned in comments, but no connection found.	Likely random, unrelated to track.
Overall Mystery	Feels erased, but track still exists on YouTube.	Limited distribution, not a conspiracy.
Conclusion
Fren, for you, this mystery is solvable with a bit of digging. "Mahatma Regatta" is out there, just not everywhere, and your mix’s removal is likely a copyright issue, not a targeted erasure. The elephants? Probably just a quirky side note. Let me know if you need help tracking down more, and I’ll rustle it up in moments! 🎧

Supreme Court revisits Fair Use Doctrine - Copyright - India
The Academy denied and disputed any copyright of the dance in Dr. Karanth stating that whatever work had been done was in the capacity of a Director of the Kendra with the assistance, finance and staff provided by the Organization of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College Trust in respect whereof a Committee was formed under him by the Board of Trustees. It was contended that Dr. Karanth was appointed as the President of the Executive Committee of Yakshagana Kendra for a period of three years by the Academy and while holding the said post only he expired. The District Judge, Udupi had decreed the said suit declaring Ms. Mallya the exclusive copyright holder in respect of seven Prasangas and that the same had accrued to her by reason of a Will as a residuary legatee. The Court restrained the Academy or their employees or agents were from performing the said seven ballets or Prasangas or any parts thereof in any manner as evolved distinctively by Dr.

Abstracts 31st Annual Conference on South Asia October 10-L3,2002 Center for South Asia flniversity of Wisconsin-Madison Abeysekara, Ananda, Virginia Tech and State University Postcolonial Religion and Public Criticism In this paper, I am concerned with questions of the following sort: How might we conceive of the study of postcolonial religion as a site of criticism? In other words, how might we think of the practice of writing about postcolonial culture and religion - in this case Buddhism, monkhood and identity in Sri Lanka -- as constituting a politics of criticism? How can such a politics of criticism be construed as an ethic of intervention in the postcolonial formations of identity and difference, religion and secularism, self and other? By looking at the conjuncture of a recent dabate, I will suggest that such a criticism/intervention can prove helpful to rethinking and reimagining new public spaces in which different practices of pluralistic and democratic being and belonging - albeit contingent ones - can be cultivated and sustained.

Kölner Künstler über Spotify: Peter Brings: „80 Millionen Streams, dann könnte ich jeden Tag im Ritz übernachten“
Auf die Spotify-Einnahmen können Peter Brings und seine Bandkollegen nicht verzichten, davon alleine leben aber bei weitem nicht. ... Welche Bedeutung hat Musikstreaming für Kölner Künstler? Wir haben bei Peter Brings, Lugatti & 9ine, Gabriel Ananda und Pogendroblem nachgefragt. Das Abspielen von Songs über Spotify ist längst zum Synonym für das Musikhören geworden. Können Kölner Künstler von ihren Streaming-Einnahmen leben, verdienen sie sich wenigstens ein nettes Zubrot oder spielt Streaming für sie keine nennenswerte Rolle? Wir haben uns mit Peter Brings, dem Rap-Duo Lugatti & 9ine, Gabriel Ananda, der sich seit 20 Jahren als DJ und Produzent in Kölns elektronischer Musikszene bewegt, und der Punkband Pogendroblem über die Bedeutung von Spotify für ihre Musik und den Umgang mit dem Quasi-Monopolisten unterhalten. Im März 2025 nutzten weltweit 268 Millionen Menschen einen Premium-Account des Streaming-Unternehmens, 678 Millionen Nutzerinnen und Nutzer verzeichnet Spotify im selben Zeitraum insgesamt.

Helping humans coexist with elephants - IndiaBioscience
Promoting coexistence of humans and elephants in Anamalai Hills (literally ​“The Elephant Hills”), situated in the Western Ghats of southern India, has been the key objective of M. Ananda Kumar for over a decade. A wildlife biologist with the Nature Conservation Foundation, Kumar is a staunch believer in the benefits that involving local communities in conservation work can reap. Kumar’s work on human – elephant conflict resolution in the Ghats has been recognized with the Carl Zeiss Wildlife Conservation Award. In an interview with Richa Malhotra, Kumar speaks of the change that has been brought about in the attitude of people towards elephants — from hostile to tolerant. ... Activities such as setting up of micro hydel projects, dams, power lines or roads in prime elephant habitats pushes these animals out of their habitat into neighbouring towns and villages.

Spotify for Artists: Neuerungen für Künstler und Labels » TONSPION
Von vielen Usern geliebt, von Künstlern gelegentlich immer noch missverstanden und unterschätzt: Spotify ist das Flaggschiff aller Musik Streaming Dienste. “Spotify for Artists” gibt Künstlern wichtige Einblicke. Was das genau ist und was es kann. Spotify erweitert stetig sein Angebot an neuen Funktionen, die Künstler*innen dabei helfen sollen, ihre Fans zu finden, aber auch Spotify dabei helfen soll, die eigene Marktmacht auszunutzen, um mehr Werbeeinnahmen durch Künstler zu erzielen. Durch diverse Möglichkeiten, Musik gegen Bezahlung in der Spotify App hervorgehoben zu platzieren, fließen immer weniger Budgets in redaktionelle Musikangebote, die über neue Künstler berichten. Aber auch Budgets, die aktuell noch auf Instagram oder TikTok investiert werden, sollen verstärkt abgegriffen werden. Wir haben hier einige der neuen Funktionen zusammengestellt, die bald im Kampagnen-Bereich von Spotify for Artists zu finden sind: Marquee ist eine bildschirmfüllende, gesponsorte Empfehlung von Neuerscheinungen, mit der Hörer*innen erreicht werden, die Interesse an der Musik eines*r Künstlers*in gezeigt haben.

Spotify vs. Deezer: Viele Gemeinsamkeiten, doch einige entscheidende Unterschiede | NETZWELT
Spotify ist im Musikstreaming-Business der Platzhirsch. Doch Deezer gewinnt seit Jahren an Bekanntheit und ist Spotify in vielen Bereichen inzwischen ebenbürtig. Den Unterschied machen die Details. Wer auf der Suche nach einem Musikstreamingdienst ist, greift wohl am ehesten zu Spotify. Dabei kann Deezer inzwischen mit dem Streaming-Giganten mithalten. (Quelle: Montage und Bildquelle: Netzwelt / Logos: Spotify, Deezer) Spotify ist noch immer der unangefochtene Marktführer unter den Musikstreaming-Anbietern. Trotzdem kommen immer wieder neue Konkurrenten auf den Markt. Obwohl es Deezer bereits seit 2007 gibt, konnte der Dienst erst in den letzten Jahren an Popularität gewinnen. Wir zeigen euch die Gründe dafür und schauen, ob Deezer endlich eine gute Spotify-Alternative ist. Spotify vs. Deezer: Ein schwerer Start ...

I am considering the user's question. It's a bit of a mystery involving a DJ mix that disappeared from YouTube, and a specific track that seems hard to find on various platforms. The user has provided some links and context, including a YouTube playlist, a specific track by Gabriel Ananda called "Mahatma Regatta," and mentions of elephants in the comments.

First, I need to understand the context better. The user was a DJ who contributed to a mix series on YouTube, but their mix (number 11) is missing from the playlist. They later found a tracklisting in a Dropbox conflicted copy, which led them to the track "Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda. However, this track is not available on the producer's Spotify, Discogs, or SoundCloud, but it is on YouTube.

The user is asking several questions:

What happened to this track?
Why has it been erased from the internet?
What do elephants have to do with it?
What's going on here?
Since this is a mystery involving internet content, I think the best approach is to use the search and browse tools to gather more information.

Let me start by searching for the track "Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda to see if there are any mentions of it being removed or any controversies associated with it.

Searching...  From the web search results, I see that "Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda is indeed a real track, released in 2008 on the label Platzhirsch. It's listed on various music databases like 1001tracklists, Last.fm, and Discogs. However, there's no immediate indication of why it might have been removed or why it's hard to find on some platforms.

I notice that on Zaycev.net, the track is listed but cannot be downloaded because the copyright holder has decided against it. This might be a clue, but it's not clear if this is related to the track's disappearance from other platforms.

Let me check if there are any mentions of copyright issues or removals specifically related to this track.

Looking at the search results, I don't see any direct mentions of the track being removed due to copyright violations. However, the user mentioned that their DJ mix was removed from YouTube due to a copyright violation notice, which is unusual for DJ mixes.

Perhaps the track "Mahatma Regatta" itself has some copyright issues that led to it being taken down from certain platforms.

Let me try to find more information about the label Platzhirsch or Gabriel Ananda's discography to see if there are any patterns or known issues.

I could also look into why the track isn't on Spotify or other streaming services.

Let me search for Gabriel Ananda's discography on Spotify to see if "Mahatma Regatta" is listed there.

But since I can't directly access Spotify, I need to use the search tool again.

Actually, I can use the browse tool to check specific websites.

Let me first confirm if "Mahatma Regatta" is on Spotify.

I can search for it on Spotify's website, but since I can't directly interact with it, I need to see if there are any web pages that mention its availability.

Let me try to search for "Gabriel Ananda Mahatma Regatta Spotify" to see if it's listed.

Searching...  From the second web search, I see that "Mahatma Regatta" is not listed on Gabriel Ananda's Spotify profile, at least not in the search results provided. This confirms the user's observation that the track is not available on Spotify.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room—literally. The user mentioned that there were comments on YouTube referencing elephants, which seems odd.

Let me search for "Gabriel Ananda Mahatma Regatta elephants" to see if there's any connection.

Searching...  The search for "Gabriel Ananda Mahatma Regatta elephants" didn't yield any direct results connecting the track to elephants. Most results are still about the track itself or Gabriel Ananda's music in general.

Perhaps the elephant references are just coincidental or from unrelated comments.

Let me try to browse the YouTube page for "Mahatma Regatta" to see if there are any comments mentioning elephants.

The user provided two YouTube links:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnJ4GUgtA4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IuNgHKNFeE&list=RD2IuNgHKNFeE&start_radio=1
I'll use the first one since it's directly the track.

Let me use the browse tool to look for comments on that page.

Browsing...  Hmm, the browse result says there are no comments mentioning elephants. Maybe the user was referring to a different video or perhaps the comments were deleted or are not visible.

Since I can't find any direct connection, I might need to approach this differently.

Let's summarize what I know so far:

"Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda is a real track released in 2008 on Platzhirsch.
It's not available on Spotify, which is unusual for a track from a known artist.
The track is available on YouTube, but the user's DJ mix that included this track was removed from YouTube due to a copyright violation.
There are no clear indications of why the track is hard to find on other platforms or why it might have been removed.
The elephant references might be unrelated or from comments that are no longer available.
Perhaps the track was never uploaded to Spotify or other streaming services, which is why it's not there. For DJ mixes, copyright issues can arise if the tracks used are not cleared for use, but in this case, the mix was removed, not the track itself.

The user mentioned that their mix was removed, not that the track was removed from all platforms. The track "Mahatma Regatta" is still available on YouTube, as the user found it.

So, why isn't it on Spotify? Maybe it was never released on streaming services, or perhaps there was a decision not to upload it.

Let me check if other tracks from the same label or by Gabriel Ananda are on Spotify.

From the earlier search, I see that Gabriel Ananda has a Spotify profile with 170.3K monthly listeners, so he does have music on Spotify.

Let me see if I can find out why "Mahatma Regatta" specifically isn't there.

Perhaps I can look for the label Platzhirsch's policy or see if other tracks from that label are on Spotify.

Let me search for "Platzhirsch label Spotify".

Searching...  From the search results, I see that Platzhirsch is a label, but it's not clear if it's the same Platzhirsch that released "Mahatma Regatta". There are different artists and labels with the name Platzhirsch on Spotify, including a song called "Platzhirsch" by various artists.

However, the label Platzhirsch Schallplatten, which released "Mahatma Regatta", might not be on Spotify, or their releases might not be available there.

Let me check if Platzhirsch Schallplatten has a presence on Spotify.

From the search, I see that there is a label called Platzhirsch Schallplatten on Discogs, but I need to see if their releases are on Spotify.

Since I can't directly search Discogs from here, I might need to use the browse tool again.

But first, let's see if I can find any information about why "Mahatma Regatta" isn't on Spotify.

Perhaps the track was never uploaded, or there was a decision not to make it available on streaming services.

Let me try to search for "Gabriel Ananda Mahatma Regatta not on Spotify" to see if there's any explanation.

Searching...  The search for "Gabriel Ananda Mahatma Regatta not on Spotify" didn't provide any specific reasons why the track isn't on Spotify. It's just not listed among his other tracks that are available.

Perhaps the track was released on a label that doesn't have a deal with Spotify, or maybe it was never digitized for streaming.

Since I can't find any specific information about why it's not on Spotify, I might need to accept that it's simply not available there for some reason.

Now, let's address the user's questions:

What happened to this track?
The track "Mahatma Regatta" is still available on YouTube, but it's not on Spotify or other streaming services that the user checked. It's possible that it was never uploaded to those platforms, or there might be licensing issues preventing it from being available.

Why has it been so successfully erased from the internet?
It hasn't been completely erased; it's still on YouTube and likely on other platforms like SoundCloud or Bandcamp, although the user didn't find it there. The user's DJ mix was removed from YouTube due to a copyright violation, which is common for DJ mixes that use copyrighted music without permission. However, the track itself is still available.

What do elephants have to do with it?
From the searches, I couldn't find any connection between the track and elephants. It's possible that the comments mentioning elephants were just random or unrelated to the track's content or history.

Fundamentally, what the hecc is going on here?
It seems like a combination of the track not being available on certain platforms and the user's DJ mix being removed due to copyright issues. The mystery might be overblown, as the track is still accessible on YouTube.

Let me double-check if the track is available on other platforms.

From the first web search, I see that it's listed on 1001tracklists, Last.fm, and Discogs, which means it's recognized and cataloged, even if not on Spotify.

Also, on Zaycev.net, it's listed but cannot be downloaded, which might indicate that the copyright holder has restricted downloading.

But since it's on YouTube, it's not completely erased.

Perhaps the user is overthinking the situation. The track exists, it's just not on all platforms, and the DJ mix was removed for copyright reasons, which is standard practice.

I think I've gathered enough information to provide an answer.reserved_14Alright, let’s break this down step by step and address your mystery. You’ve got a DJ mix that vanished from YouTube, a track called "Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda that’s hard to find on most platforms, and some strange references to elephants in the comments. You’re asking what happened to the track, why it seems to have been “erased” from the internet, what the elephants have to do with it, and what’s really going on. Let’s dig into this.

Step 1: What happened to the track "Mahatma Regatta"?
The track exists and is still available.
"Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda is a real track, released in 2008 on the label Platzhirsch Schallplatten. It’s listed on music databases like Discogs, 1001tracklists, and Last.fm, which confirms its existence. You even found it on YouTube, so it’s not completely gone.
Why isn’t it on Spotify or other streaming services?
Despite being a real track, "Mahatma Regatta" is not available on Spotify. Gabriel Ananda does have a Spotify profile with other tracks, so it’s not that his music isn’t on the platform. However, this specific track might not have been uploaded to streaming services for several reasons:
Label distribution: Platzhirsch Schallplatten, the label that released "Mahatma Regatta," might not have had a deal with Spotify or other streaming platforms at the time of release (2008). Streaming services like Spotify were still relatively new back then, and not all labels prioritized uploading their catalogs.
Licensing issues: The track might involve samples or elements that weren’t cleared for streaming distribution, or there could have been a decision by the label or artist not to make it available on streaming platforms.
Artist or label choice: Sometimes, artists or labels choose not to upload certain tracks to streaming services, especially if they prefer to keep them exclusive to physical formats or specific platforms.
Why is it hard to find on other platforms like SoundCloud or Bandcamp?
You mentioned not finding it on SoundCloud or Bandcamp, which is unusual but not unheard of. It’s possible that:
The track was never officially uploaded to these platforms.
It might have been removed due to copyright issues or label decisions.
Smaller labels like Platzhirsch Schallplatten might not have prioritized uploading older tracks to newer platforms.
In short, the track isn’t “erased” from the internet—it’s just not on all platforms. It’s still accessible on YouTube, and you can likely find it on niche music databases or even purchase it as a physical copy if you dig deep enough.

Step 2: Why has it been “erased” from the internet?
It hasn’t been erased—it’s just not widely available.
As mentioned, "Mahatma Regatta" is still on YouTube, and it’s cataloged on music databases like Discogs and 1001tracklists. The perception of it being “erased” might come from:
Your DJ mix being removed: You mentioned that your DJ mix (which included this track) was removed from YouTube due to a copyright violation notice. This is common for DJ mixes, as they often use copyrighted music without explicit permission. However, this doesn’t mean the track itself was removed from all platforms—just your mix.
Limited distribution: The track might not have been widely distributed to streaming services or other platforms, making it harder to find compared to more mainstream tracks.
Why did your DJ mix get removed?
DJ mixes are inherently vulnerable to copyright takedowns because they often include tracks that aren’t owned by the DJ. While many DJ mixes stay up on YouTube without issues, they can be flagged if someone (like a label or rights holder) decides to enforce copyright. In this case:
All the mixes in the series you mentioned are DJ mixes, so they’re all technically vulnerable to copyright claims.
However, only your mix (number 11) was removed, which is odd. This could be due to:
Specific targeting: Maybe someone (a label, artist, or automated system) flagged your mix specifically, while the others were overlooked.
Timing: Your mix might have been flagged years later when copyright enforcement became stricter or when someone decided to clean up old content.
Is there something special about "Mahatma Regatta"?
There’s no evidence that "Mahatma Regatta" itself has any unique copyright issues that would explain why it’s harder to find. It’s just not on streaming services, which is unusual but not unprecedented for older techno tracks from smaller labels.
Step 3: What do elephants have to do with it?
The elephant references are likely unrelated.
You mentioned that the YouTube comments on the track included references to elephants, which seemed strange. However:
When I searched for any connection between "Mahatma Regatta" and elephants, I found nothing. There’s no mention of elephants in the track’s title, lyrics (if any), or artist information.
It’s possible that the comments were:
Random or coincidental: YouTube comments can be quirky, and people sometimes post unrelated things.
Deleted or no longer visible: Since I couldn’t find any comments mentioning elephants when I browsed the YouTube page for "Mahatma Regatta," they might have been removed, or you might have seen them on a different video.
No deeper meaning: There’s no indication that elephants are tied to the track’s content, production, or removal. It’s likely just a red herring.
Step 4: What’s really going on here?
The mystery is a mix of limited distribution and copyright takedowns.
Here’s what seems to have happened:
"Mahatma Regatta" is a legitimate track released in 2008, but it was never uploaded to major streaming services like Spotify. This could be due to label distribution choices, licensing issues, or simply because it wasn’t prioritized for streaming.
Your DJ mix, which included this track, was removed from YouTube due to a copyright violation notice. This is standard for DJ mixes, especially if they’re flagged by rights holders.
The track itself is still available on YouTube, which means it hasn’t been “erased” from the internet—it’s just not on all platforms.
The elephant references in the comments are likely unrelated and don’t have any deeper significance.
Why does it feel like a mystery?
The fact that your mix was removed while others in the series weren’t might feel suspicious, but it’s probably just a result of how copyright enforcement works—sometimes it’s inconsistent.
The track being hard to find on streaming services might make it feel “erased,” but it’s still out there if you know where to look (e.g., YouTube, Discogs, or even purchasing a physical copy).
Final Answer
What happened to the track?
"Mahatma Regatta" by Gabriel Ananda is still available on YouTube and cataloged on music databases like Discogs and 1001tracklists. However, it’s not on Spotify or other streaming services, likely because it was never uploaded there by the label (Platzhirsch Schallplatten) or due to licensing issues.
Why has it been “erased” from the internet?
It hasn’t been erased—it’s just not on all platforms. Your DJ mix was removed from YouTube due to a copyright violation, which is common for DJ mixes. The track itself is still accessible on YouTube.
What do elephants have to do with it?
Nothing, as far as I can tell. The references to elephants in the comments are likely unrelated or coincidental.
What’s going on here?
The track exists but isn’t widely distributed on streaming services. Your DJ mix was removed due to copyright issues, but the track itself is still available. There’s no deeper conspiracy—just a combination of limited distribution and standard copyright enforcement.
